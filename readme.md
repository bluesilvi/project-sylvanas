# Project Sylvanas

This repository contains a collection of example projects and other useful resources demonstrating the capabilities of the Project Sylvanas API. Each example is self-contained with its own documentation and code.

## Resources
Here are some useful resources for learning more about Project Sylvanas:

- [User Documentation](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/)
- [Developer Documentation](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/dev)
- [Example Documentation](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/examples)

## IZI SDK
Examples in the [IZI directory](izi) leverage the **[IZI SDK](/dev/libraries/izi)** - a high-level toolkit that provides cleaner, more intuitive APIs and powerful utilities. These examples are ideal for:

- **Faster development** - Write less boilerplate code and focus on features
- **Modern best practices** - Use event-driven patterns, helpers, and smart abstractions
- **Complex features** - Build advanced functionality with less effort
- **Production plugins** - Create professional-grade solutions quickly

**Best for:** Developers building new plugins, implementing complex features, or who prefer working with modern, high-level APIs.

**This also our new recommended way to build plugins as it provides a more intuitive and powerful API for plugin development. It simplifies the process of creating plugins by abstracting away low-level details and providing a clean, easy-to-use interface.**

## Legacy API
Examples in the [Legacy directory](legacy) use **only the Core API** - the low-level functions and methods that form the foundation of Project Sylvanas. These examples are ideal for:

- **Understanding the fundamentals** - See exactly how the system works under the hood
- **Maximum control** - Fine-tune every aspect of your implementation
- **Learning the basics** - Build a solid foundation before using higher-level abstractions
- **Legacy code maintenance** - Work with existing scripts that don't use modern libraries

**Best for:** Developers who want to understand the core mechanisms, need precise control, or are maintaining existing code.
